# Virtual Reality will make the workePLACE irrelivant.
It sounds insane now - but not long from now, VR will mean we'll be switching from 'face-to-face' meetings with each other at the flick of a switch. One minute sat in a board room in New York - the next in a cafe in Edinburgh. Physical location will become less and less relevant as the awkwardness and boundary between physical and virtual presence narrows. This is going to upturn property markets as we know them - as they'll become far more influenced by where people actually want to be, than where they need to be.

It's probably one of the most fascinating upcoming changes to human society. Many people reject it as a horrible idea that we'll all be cooped up in virtual environments and never have real interaction with each other - almost like in the Matrix. But that's missing the point.

Yes - If you're able to have a fully immersive virtual meeting with someone - you will always know that you're not really attached - no matter how realistic it seems. You'll know that in reality you are not breathing the same air as the person in that room - there will inherently less emotional connection because of that very knowledge. But what could you gain on the flipside.

You might actually be *physically* present in the mountains or countryside. You could step out of your remote meeting - and breathe in physical countryside air. And you would KNOW that was real air hitting your lungs.
What if you're someone who constantly needs to go on business trips - and as a result hardly see your kids grow up?

You'd now have time to hang out with your family. You'd know when you ruffled your son's hair - you were really making that physical connection.
That'd be enough to want to disconnect from the VR - and take the real world in. We wouldn't choose to be forever isolated and plugged-in.

Who would you rather have that emotional connection with? Friends and family - or potential clients?
