# Stop pussy-footing around Blockchain

Remember a couple of years back I mentioned of BitCoin - and how it or a similar tech will
become the next means of inherent transactions specifically talking about property transactions
but actually the transaction of high value items.

People are waking up to it. Slowly.

Everything in the real-world chain that solicitors have to go hunt for... can - and should be
- in a centralised encrypted ledger basically - blockchain.

It's insanity not to go that way.
It's a perfect solution
It's decentralised but unfragmented
No 'Saas' product or server to hold all of everyones records
It's a movable source of truth - all records...and only the true owner (and / or an approved body) can modify it...

Nobody has to go hunt for anything - the records are there by default
If anything critical happens to a property - then the approved parties will update the ledger

And then when ownership is transferred..  it's all there.

Digital representation of the transfer of high value items... Do it...
